# Responsive-Web-Design-Development-Assessment-2

S2 Multi-Device Application Assessment Brief
Key Information
Deadline 20 January 2025 - 11:59 PM
Marking tutor Mr. Oliver I C. Malapit
Contribution to overall module mark 50%
The Brief
You are tasked to create a single-page web application, comprised of a responsive front-end
written in HTML/CSS and a small back-end created using Node.js. It is up to you what your
application will be. For example, it could be a storefront, a practical utility, or an interactive
experience. But, you should discuss your idea with your tutor before you start to ensure it is within
the scope of the brief.
The front-end should be responsive to at least phone and desktop devices. You should
demonstrate a solid grasp of responsive design principles, focusing on both visual clarity and user
experience. The back-end should serve static content (e.g. stylesheets, images, etc) and
implement at least one additional feature. For example, it might serve a dynamic webpage, use
data from a database or web API, or allow users to “log-in” to access content. Your implementation
should efficiently use modern web development techniques.
You must iteratively design, implement, and document your project. Your documentation should
explain how and why you changed the application as you iterated, and provide clear evidence of
the process. Evidence could include design wireframes, test plans, peer feedback, and GitHub
commits.
Deliverables
The deliverables for this assignment are as follows:
 The Application. (A GitHub repository that contains all required code and assets)
 A 1,000 word development document. (Word or PDF), including evidence of iteration.
 A short video walkthrough of your website across different screen sizes.
The Application
The Node.js project folder required to run your Multi-Device Application. This should be submitted
to the corresponding folder in your GitHub repository. If you are unsure, ask your tutor.
You should commit the package.json file but should not commit the node_modules folder. Your
GitHub repository should be configured to do this by default. If you encounter issues, please
contact your tutor.
The Development Document
Your Multi-Device Application must be accompanied by a development document of 1,000-1,500
words. You should include any evidence of an iterative process in the development document.
It is up to you what sections your document will include. However, you must include the following
elements:
 Brief: A short description of your Multi-Device Application, including its key features, target
device types, and any requirements you might have set. You should also provide a link to
your GitHub repository and to your walkthrough video. (~100 words)
 Development Breakdown: Outline and explain 3-5 key decisions you have made during
the development of your application. This should include both design decisions (e.g. how
and design differs between devices and why) and technical decisions (e.g. how and why
you implemented a key feature). You should explain how iteration, testing, and/or peer
feedback informed these decisions. (~500 words)
 Critical Reflection: Critically analyse your application to explain its successes, its
limitations, and how it could be improved. You should also describe any personal reflections
on how you could further improve your own web development skills. (~400 words)
 Appendix: You may include evidence of iteration in appendices at the end of your
document. You may also upload files to your GitHub repository and include the link in your
document. Appendices do not count towards the word count.
Walkthrough Video
You should also submit a brief walkthrough video to your GitHub repository and include the link at
the top of your development document. The video should demonstrate how your application
responds across different screen sizes and any key features of your application.
n.b. The content of this video is not a part of your documentation and will not be marked. However,
it will be referenced by the marker and moderator to see how your application functions on your
personal computer.
Submission
Please follow the submission instructions below. Work that is submitted incorrectly may not be
accepted or could incur a points penalty.
Before submitting have you…
 Checked that your work is functioning as expected?
 Spell-checked and grammar-checked any written work that accompanies your digital work?
Please make an appointment with the Academic Skills team or speak to your tutor if you are
experiencing challenges in this area.
 Formatted your written work to the specification below?
 Referenced all sources of information accurately? Please refer to
www.citethemrightonline.com (Harvard) for guidance.
Your development document must be submitted via Turnitin and code submitted via your GitHub
repository. Please adhere to the following method:
 Check your Multi-Device Application is working as expected.
 Commit and push the final version to your Web Dev II Github repository. Ensure you push
all the files required to run your application, including code, assets, and the package.json
file.
 Ensure you have included links to your GitHub repository and walkthrough video at the
beginning of your Development Document.
 Save your development document as a Word document or PDF file.
 On Minerva, find the Multi-Device Application submission portal in the Assessment folder.
 Submit your development document.
Only code pushed to your GitHub repository before the assessment deadline will be marked.
Ensure you give yourself enough time before your final push.
Format
All written work must conform to university styling and submission guidelines. They must:
 Contain appropriate in-text citation that supplies an accurate list of references.
 Be accurate in referencing. See Bath Spa guidelines and the Harvard system described at
www.citethemrightonline.com.
 Be accurate in spelling and paragraphing.
Use of online sources
If you take any code from online resources - including AI tools and online tutorials - to support the
development of your application, you must fully acknowledge their use by referencing the source
in both code comments and in a references list at the end of your development document.
 Code Comments: A reference in the code comments should be added ahead of the section
of code that has been taken or heavily developed using online resources.
 For standard online sources you should include the title of the webpage and full URL.
 For Generative AI tools you should include the name of the tool and the prompt provided to
generate the code.
 Reference List: A full reference list should also be included at the end of your development
document. These references should be in alphabetical order.
 For standard online sources you should follow the Harvard standard for websites.
 For Generative AI tools you should follow the Harvard standard for generative AI.
If you are unsure of how to appropriately reference, please consult your tutor. Failure to
appropriately acknowledge use of online resources may result in an academic misconduct
accusation.
Also be aware that use of online resources to develop your code should be kept to a minimum and
excessive use may be deemed academic misconduct. The flowchart below is offered as guidance
to what is and is not acceptable. Again, if you are unsure, please consult your tutor.
Am I Plagiarising Code?
Marking Criteria
The Multi-Device Application will be marked against the following criteria:
 Responsive Design and User Experience Design (30%) - Quality of visual design and
user experience design across device types.
 Technical Implementation (40%) - Use of front-end and back-end techniques. Use of code
conventions (e.g. comments, indentation, kebab-case, etc) and GitHub (e.g. file structure,
regular commits, etc).
 Documentation (20%) – Clarity and depth of information and explanations provided. Depth
of critical reflection.
 Evidence of Iteration (10%) - Evidence of iterative design, implementation, testing, and
peer feedback to inform the final outcome.
